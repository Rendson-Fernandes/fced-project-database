# Database Project (FCED Project 2022)

Brief explanation of how create a database through a csv file. We had to represent an UML, ER, create database and respective tables (races.sql), as well an INSERT and DELETE method script to change tables (load_races.py). At the end we create a User Interaction script in python that allow users to interact with database (races.py).

This project was made by BÃ¡rbara Zanetti, Diogo Cruz and Rendson Fernandes

## UML
[uml](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/48aa113e-50a4-4fdc-8b27-3902b3a72421/edit?viewport_loc=-141%2C-396%2C1880%2C1034%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_e575e21d-d189-4e1e-bc62-f36aba3fce48)

## ER
athlete	(id_athlete, name, sex, nation, birth_date)

runner (id_runner, id_event, bib, id_athlete, age_class)

events (id_event, event, event_year,	distance)

event_ranking (id_event, id_runner,	place,	place_in_class, official_time,	net_time, (bib)) 

runner_teams (id_team--> teams, id_runner-->runner)

teams (id_team, team)

## Python script: Prepare dataframes to create tables on database
We clean duplicated rows and split data between 6 dataframes: athlete, runner, events, event_ranking, runner_teams, teams
